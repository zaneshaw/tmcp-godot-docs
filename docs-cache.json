This feature helps you break down and organize your\ngame's different components.You can create as many scenes as you'd like and save them as files with the\n.tscn extension, which stands for \"text scene\". The label.tscn file from\nthe previous lesson was an example. We call those files \"Packed Scenes\" as they\npack information about your scene's content.Here's an example of a ball. It's composed of a RigidBody2D node as its root named Ball, which allows the ball to fall\nand bounce on walls, a Sprite2D node, and a\nCollisionShape2D.Once you saved a scene, it works as a blueprint: you can reproduce it in other\nscenes as many times as you'd like. Replicating an object from a template like\nthis is called instancing.As we mentioned in the previous part, instanced scenes behave like a node: the\neditor hides their content by default. When you instance the Ball, you only see\nthe Ball node. Notice also how each duplicate has a unique name.Every instance of the Ball scene starts with the same structure and properties\nas ball.tscn. However, you can modify each independently, such as changing\nhow they bounce, how heavy they are, or any property exposed by the source\nscene.",

In our _process()\nfunction, replace the rotation += angular_speed * delta line with the\ncode below.Our direction local variable is a multiplier representing the direction in\nwhich the player wants to turn. A value of 0 means the player isn't pressing\nthe left or the right arrow key. A value of 1 means the player wants to turn\nright, and -1 means they want to turn left.To produce these values, we introduce conditions and the use of Input. A\ncondition starts with the if keyword in GDScript and ends with a colon. The\ncondition is the expression between the keyword and the end of the line.To check if a key was pressed this frame, we call Input.is_action_pressed().\nThe method takes a text string representing an input action and returns true\nif the action is pressed, false otherwise.The two actions we use above, \"ui_left\" and \"ui_right\", are predefined in every\nGodot project. They respectively trigger when the player presses the left and\nright arrows on the keyboard or left and right on a gamepad's D-pad.Finally, we use the direction as a multiplier when we update the node's\nrotation: rotation += angular_speed * direction * delta.If you run the scene with this code, the icon should rotate when you press\nLeft and Right.",

Other nodes can\nconnect to that signal and call a function when the event occurs.Signals are a delegation mechanism built into Godot that allows one game object to\nreact to a change in another without them referencing one another. Using signals\nlimits coupling and keeps your\ncode flexible.For example, you might have a life bar on the screen that represents the\nplayer's health. When the player takes damage or uses a healing potion, you want\nthe bar to reflect the change. To do so, in Godot, you would use signals.We will now use a signal to make our Godot icon from the previous lesson\n(Listening to player input) move and stop by pressing a button.",

Click the Player node and click the \"Attach\nScript\" button:In the script settings window, you can leave the default settings alone. Just\nclick \"Create\":Start by declaring the member variables this object will need:Using the export keyword on the first variable speed allows us to set\nits value in the Inspector.

Click on the Player\nnode and you'll see the property now appears in the \"Script Variables\" section\nof the Inspector. Remember, if you change the value here, it will override the\nvalue written in the script.Your player.gd script should already contain\na _ready() and a _process() function.\nIf you didn't select the default template shown above,\ncreate these functions while following the lesson.The _ready() function is called when a node enters the scene tree, which is\na good time to find the size of the game window:Now we can use the _process() function to define what the player will do.\n_process() is called every frame, so we'll use it to update elements of our\ngame, which we expect will change often. For the player, we need to do the\nfollowing:First, we need to check for input - is the player pressing a key? For this game,\nwe have 4 direction inputs to check. Input actions are defined in the Project\nSettings under \"Input Map\". Here, you can define custom events and assign\ndifferent keys, mouse events, or other inputs to them. For this game, we will\nmap the arrow keys to the four directions.Click on Project -> Project Settings to open the project settings window and\nclick on the Input Map tab at the top. Type \"move_right\" in the top bar and\nclick the \"Add\" button to add the move_right action.We need to assign a key to this action. Click the \"+\" icon on the right, to\nopen the event manager window.The \"Listening for Input...\" field should automatically be selected.\nPress the \"right\" key on your keyboard, and the menu should look like this now.Select the \"ok\" button. The \"right\" key is now associated with the move_right action.Repeat these steps to add three more mappings:Your input map tab should look like this:Click the \"Close\" button to close the project settings.You can detect whether a key is pressed using Input.is_action_pressed(),\nwhich returns true if it's pressed or false if it isn't.We start by setting the velocity to (0, 0) - by default, the player\nshould not be moving. Then we check each input and add/subtract from the\nvelocity to obtain a total direction. For example, if you hold right and\ndown at the same time, the resulting velocity vector will be (1, 1).\nIn this case, since we're adding a horizontal and a vertical movement, the\nplayer would move faster diagonally than if it just moved horizontally.We can prevent that if we normalize the velocity, which means we set its\nlength to 1, then multiply by the desired speed. This means no more fast\ndiagonal movement.We also check whether the player is moving so we can call play() or\nstop() on the AnimatedSprite2D.Now that we have a movement direction, we can update the player's position. We\ncan also use clamp() to prevent it from leaving the screen. Clamping a\nvalue means restricting it to a given range. Add the following to the bottom of\nthe _process function (make sure it's not indented under the else):Click \"Play Scene\" (F6, Cmd + R on macOS) and confirm you can move\nthe player around the screen in all directions.",

Select the Player node again and add a child node\nCollisionShape3D. In the Inspector, on the Shape property, add a new SphereShape3D.The sphere's wireframe appears below the character.It will be the shape the physics engine uses to collide with the environment, so\nwe want it to better fit the 3D model. Shrink it a bit by dragging the orange\ndot in the viewport. My sphere has a radius of about 0.8 meters.Then, move the shape up so its bottom roughly aligns with the grid's plane.You can toggle the model's visibility by clicking the eye icon next to the\nCharacter or the Pivot nodes.Save the scene as player.tscnWith the nodes ready, we can almost get coding. But first, we need to define\nsome input actions.",

We're going to use the input actions we created in the last\npart to move the character.Right-click the Player node and select Attach Script to add a new script to\nit. In the popup, set the Template to Empty before pressing the Create\nbutton.Let's start with the class's properties. We're going to define a movement speed,\na fall acceleration representing gravity, and a velocity we'll use to move the\ncharacter.These are common properties for a moving body. The target_velocity is a 3D vector\ncombining a speed with a direction. Here, we define it as a property because\nwe want to update and reuse its value across frames.Let's code the movement. We start by calculating the input direction vector\nusing the global Input object, in _physics_process().Here, we're going to make all calculations using the _physics_process()\nvirtual function. Like _process(), it allows you to update the node every\nframe, but it's designed specifically for physics-related code like moving a\nkinematic or rigid body.We start by initializing a direction variable to Vector3.ZERO. Then, we\ncheck if the player is pressing one or more of the move_* inputs and update\nthe vector's x and z components accordingly. These correspond to the\nground plane's axes.These four conditions give us eight possibilities and eight possible directions.In case the player presses, say, both W and D simultaneously, the vector will\nhave a length of about 1.4. But if they press a single key, it will have a\nlength of 1. We want the vector's length to be consistent, and not move faster diagonally. To do so, we can\ncall its normalize() method.Here, we only normalize the vector if the direction has a length greater than\nzero, which means the player is pressing a direction key.In this case, we also get the Pivot node and call its look_at() method.\nThis method takes a position in space to look at in global coordinates and the\nup direction. In this case, we can use the Vector3.UP constant.In 3D, the property that contains a node's position is position. By\nadding the direction to it, we get a position to look at that's one meter\naway from the Player.Then, we update the velocity. We have to calculate the ground velocity and the\nfall speed separately. Be sure to go back one tab so the lines are inside the\n_physics_process() function but outside the condition we just wrote above.The CharacterBody3D.is_on_floor() function returns true if the body collided with the floor in this frame. That's why\nwe apply gravity to the Player only while it is in the air.For the vertical velocity, we subtract the fall acceleration multiplied by the\ndelta time every frame.\nThis line of code will cause our character to fall in every frame, as long it is not on or collides with the floor.The physics engine can only detect interactions with walls, the floor, or other\nbodies during a given frame if movement and collisions happen. We will use this\nproperty later to code the jump.On the last line, we call CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide() which is a powerful\nmethod of the CharacterBody3D class that allows you to move a character\nsmoothly. If it hits a wall midway through a motion, the engine will try to\nsmooth it out for you. It uses the velocity value native to the CharacterBody3DAnd that's all the code you need to move the character on the floor.Here is the complete Player.gd code for reference.",

Anything in-between is an interpolation.Between two real (floating-point) numbers, an interpolation can be described as:And often simplified to:The name of this type of interpolation, which transforms a value into another at constant speed is \"linear\".

This process of factoring in all those wanted navigation restrictions from other engine parts like visuals and collision is commonly called navigation mesh baking.If you experience clipping or collision problems while following navigation paths always remember that you need to tell the navigation system through an appropriated navigation mesh what your intentions are.

Instead, when\nan agent reaches the position of a link, game code needs to react (e.g. through area triggers) and provide means for the agent\nto move through the link to end up at the links other position (e.g. through teleport or animation) to continue along the path.",

You can turn it off and back on by calling Node.set_process().The engine calls this method every time it draws a frame:Keep in mind that the frequency at which the engine calls _process() depends\non your application's framerate, which varies over time and across devices.The function's delta parameter is the time elapsed in seconds since the\nprevious call to _process(). Use this parameter to make calculations\nindependent of the framerate. For example, you should always multiply a speed\nvalue by delta to animate a moving object.Physics processing works with a similar virtual function:\n_physics_process(). Use it for calculations that must happen before each\nphysics step, like moving a character that collides with the game world. As\nmentioned above, _physics_process() runs at fixed time intervals as much as\npossible to keep the physics interactions stable. You can change the interval\nbetween physics steps in the Project Settings, under Physics -> Common ->\nPhysics Fps. By default, it's set to run 60 times per second.The engine calls this method before every physics step:The function _process() is not synchronized with physics. Its rate depends on\nhardware and game optimization. It also runs after the physics step in\nsingle-threaded games.You can see the _process() function at work by creating a scene with a\nsingle Label node, with the following script attached to it:When you run the scene, you should see a counter increasing each frame.",

That node's children may not be part of the active scene yet. As\nyou can remove and re-add nodes to the scene tree, this function may be called\nmultiple times throughout a node's lifetime.Most of the time, you'll use _ready() instead. This function is called only\nonce in a node's lifetime, after _enter_tree(). _ready() ensures that all children\nhave entered the scene tree first, so you can safely call get_node() on it.Another related callback is _exit_tree(), which the engine calls every time\na node exits the scene tree. This can be when you call Node.remove_child() or when you free a node.The two virtual methods _process() and _physics_process() allow you to\nupdate the node, every frame and every physics frame respectively. For more\ninformation, read the dedicated documentation:\nIdle and Physics Processing.Two more essential built-in node callback functions are\nNode._unhandled_input() and\nNode._input(), which you use to both receive\nand process individual input events. The _unhandled_input() method receives\nevery key press, mouse click, etc. that have not been handled already in an\n_input() callback or in a user interface component. You want to use it for\ngameplay input in general. The _input() callback allows you to intercept and\nprocess input events before _unhandled_input() gets them.To learn more about inputs in Godot, see the Input section.There are some more overridable functions like\nNode._get_configuration_warnings(). Specialized node types provide\nmore callbacks like CanvasItem._draw() to\ndraw programmatically or Control._gui_input() to handle clicks and input on UI elements.",

They were initially used to shade 3D scenes but can nowadays do much\nmore. You can use them to control how the engine draws geometry and pixels on\nthe screen, allowing you to achieve all sorts of effects.Modern rendering engines like Godot draw everything with shaders: graphics cards\ncan run thousands of instructions in parallel, leading to incredible rendering\nspeed.Because of their parallel nature, though, shaders don't process information the\nway a typical program does. Shader code runs on each vertex or pixel in\nisolation. You cannot store data between frames either. As a result, when\nworking with shaders, you need to code and think differently from other\nprogramming languages.Suppose you want to update all the pixels in a texture to a given color.

                    "blurb": "This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a minimal compute\nshader. But first, a bit of background on compute shaders and how they work with\nGodot.A compute shader is a special type of shader program that is orientated towards\ngeneral purpose programming. In other words, they are more flexible than vertex\nshaders and fragment shaders as they don't have a fixed purpose (i.e.\ntransforming vertices or writing colors to an image). Unlike fragment shaders\nand vertex shaders, compute shaders have very little going on behind the scenes.\nThe code you write is what the GPU runs and very little else. This can make them\na very useful tool to offload heavy calculations to the GPU.Now let's get started by creating a short compute shader.First, in the external text editor of your choice, create a new file called\ncompute_example.glsl in your project folder. When you write compute shaders\nin Godot, you write them in GLSL directly. The Godot shader language is based on\nGLSL. If you are familiar with normal shaders in Godot, the syntax below will\nlook somewhat familiar.Let's take a look at this compute shader code:This code takes an array of floats, multiplies each element by 2 and store the\nresults back in the buffer array. Now let's look at it line-by-line.These two lines communicate two things:You should never have to change these two lines for your custom compute shaders.Next, we communicate the number of invocations to be used in each workgroup.\nInvocations are instances of the shader that are running within the same\nworkgroup. When we launch a compute shader from the CPU, we tell it how many\nworkgroups to run. Workgroups run in parallel to each other. While running one\nworkgroup, you cannot access information in another workgroup. However,\ninvocations in the same workgroup can have some limited access to other invocations.Think about workgroups and invocations as a giant nested for loop.Workgroups and invocations are an advanced topic. For now, remember that we will\nbe running two invocations per workgroup.Here we provide information about the memory that the compute shader will have\naccess to. The layout property allows us to tell the shader where to look\nfor the buffer, we will need to match these set and binding positions\nfrom the CPU side later.The restrict keyword tells the shader that this buffer is only going to be\naccessed from one place in this shader. In other words, we won't bind this\nbuffer in another set or binding index. This is important as it allows\nthe shader compiler to optimize the shader code. Always use restrict when\nyou can.This is an unsized buffer, which means it can be any size. So we need to be\ncareful not to read from an index larger than the size of the buffer.Finally, we write the main function which is where all the logic happens. We\naccess a position in the storage buffer using the gl_GlobalInvocationID\nbuilt in variables. gl_GlobalInvocationID gives you the global unique ID for\nthe current invocation.To continue, write the code above into your newly created compute_example.glsl\nfile.",

Unfortunately, that is rarely the\ncase.Only TVs nowadays have a standard resolution and aspect ratio.\nEverything else, from computer monitors to tablets, portable consoles\nand mobile phones have different resolutions and aspect ratios.There are several ways to handle this, but for now, let's just imagine\nthat the screen resolution has changed and the controls need to be\nre-positioned. Some will need to follow the bottom of the screen, others\nthe top of the screen, or maybe the right or left margins.This is done by editing the margin properties of controls. Each\ncontrol has four margins: left, right, bottom, and top, which correspond\nto the respective edges of the control. By default, all of\nthem represent a distance in pixels relative to the top-left corner of\nthe parent control or (in case there is no parent control) the viewport.So to make the control wider you can make the right margin larger and/or\nmake the left margin smaller. This lets you set the exact placement\nand shape of the control.The anchor properties adjust where the margin distances are relative to.\nEach margin has an individual anchor that can be adjusted from the\nbeginning to the end of the parent. So the vertical (top, bottom) anchors\nadjust from 0 (top of parent) to 1.0 (bottom of parent) with 0.5 being\nthe center, and the control margins will be placed relative to that\npoint. The horizontal (left, right) anchors similarly adjust from left to\nright of the parent.Note that when you wish the edge of a control to be above or left of the\nanchor point, you must change the margin value to be negative.For example: when horizontal anchors are changed to 1, the margin values\nbecome relative to the top-right corner of the parent control or viewport.Adjusting the two horizontal or the two vertical anchors to different\nvalues will make the control change size when the parent control does.\nHere, the control is set to anchor its bottom-right corner to the\nparent's bottom-right, while the top-left control margins are still\nanchored to the top-left of the parent, so when re-sizing the parent,\nthe control will always cover it, leaving a 20 pixel margin:",

These work like normal theme types, but instead\nof being self-sufficient and standalone they extend another, base type.Following the previous example, your theme can have some styles, colors, and fonts\ndefined for the Button type, customizing the looks of every button element in your UI.\nTo then have a gray, red, or blue button you would create a new type, e.g. GrayButton, and\nmark it as a variation of the base Button type.Type variations can replace some aspects of the base type, but keep others.\nThey can also define properties that the base style hasn't defined. For example,\nyour GrayButton can override the normal style from the base Button\nand add font_color that Button has never defined.

At face value this seems to work.\nHowever, upon closer examination this model does not take into account that there are two forms of movement in XR.\nThe movement through controller input, and the physical movement of the player in the real world.As a result, the origin node does not represent the position of the player.\nIt represents the center, or start of, the tracking space in which the player can physically move.\nAs the player moves around their room this movement is represented through the tracking of the players headset.\nIn game this translates to the camera node's position being updated accordingly.\nFor all intents and purposes, we are tracking a disembodied head.\nUnless body tracking is available, we have no knowledge of the position or orientation of the player's body.The first problem this causes is fairly obvious.\nWhen the player moves with controller input, we can use the same approach in normal games and move the player in a forward direction.\nHowever the player isn't where we think they are and as we move forward we're checking collisions in the wrong location.The second problem really shows itself when the player walks further away from the center of the tracking space and uses controller input to turn.\nIf we rotate our character body, the player will be moved around the room in a circular fashion.If we fix the above issues, we will find a third issue.\nWhen the path for the player is blocked in the virtual world, the player can still physically move forward.We will look at solving the first two problem with two separate solutions, and then discuss dealing with the third.",

In addition, often times such assets are distributed\nunder non-free, proprietary licenses, limiting what you can do with them.The Asset Library is different - all assets are distributed free of charge, and under\na host of open source licenses (such as the MIT license, the GPL, and the Boost Software License).\nThis makes the AssetLib more similar to the software repositories of a Linux distribution.This set of pages will cover how to use the AssetLib (both from inside Godot, and on the\nwebsite), how you can submit your own assets, and what the guidelines for submission are.Please note that the AssetLib is relatively young - it may have various pain points, bugs,\nand usability issues. As with all Godot projects, the code repository is available on GitHub,\nwhere you can submit pull requests and issues, so please do not hesitate to visit it!",

                "description": "\n\n<p>Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of another node, resulting in a tree arrangement. A given node can contain any number of nodes as children with the requirement that all siblings (direct children of a node) should have unique names.</p>\n<p>A tree of nodes is called a <em>scene</em>. Scenes can be saved to the disk and then instantiated into other scenes. This allows for very high flexibility in the architecture and data model of Godot projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Scene tree:</strong> The <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_scenetree.html#class-scenetree\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">SceneTree</span></a> contains the active tree of nodes. When a node is added to the scene tree, it receives the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-constant-notification-enter-tree\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE</span></a> notification and its <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-enter-tree\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_enter_tree</span></a> callback is triggered. Child nodes are always added <em>after</em> their parent node, i.e. the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-enter-tree\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_enter_tree</span></a> callback of a parent node will be triggered before its child's.</p>\n<p>Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-constant-notification-ready\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">NOTIFICATION_READY</span></a> notification and their respective <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-ready\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_ready</span></a> callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-ready\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_ready</span></a> callback is called in reverse order, starting with the children and moving up to the parent nodes.</p>\n<p>This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order will be used for the callbacks: <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-enter-tree\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_enter_tree</span></a> of the parent, <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-enter-tree\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_enter_tree</span></a> of the children, <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-ready\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_ready</span></a> of the children and finally <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-ready\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_ready</span></a> of the parent (recursively for the entire scene tree).</p>\n<p><strong>Processing:</strong> Nodes can override the \"process\" state, so that they receive a callback on each frame requesting them to process (do something). Normal processing (callback <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-process\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_process</span></a>, toggled with <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-set-process\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">set_process</span></a>) happens as fast as possible and is dependent on the frame rate, so the processing time <em>delta</em> (in seconds) is passed as an argument. Physics processing (callback <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-physics-process\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_physics_process</span></a>, toggled with <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-set-physics-process\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">set_physics_process</span></a>) happens a fixed number of times per second (60 by default) and is useful for code related to the physics engine.</p>\n<p>Nodes can also process input events. When present, the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-input\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_input</span></a> function will be called for each input that the program receives. In many cases, this can be overkill (unless used for simple projects), and the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-unhandled-input\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_unhandled_input</span></a> function might be preferred; it is called when the input event was not handled by anyone else (typically, GUI <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_control.html#class-control\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Control</span></a> nodes), ensuring that the node only receives the events that were meant for it.</p>\n<p>To keep track of the scene hierarchy (especially when instancing scenes into other scenes), an \"owner\" can be set for the node with the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-property-owner\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">owner</span></a> property. This keeps track of who instantiated what. This is mostly useful when writing editors and tools, though.</p>\n<p>Finally, when a node is freed with <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_object.html#class-object-method-free\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Object.free</span></a> or <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-queue-free\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">queue_free</span></a>, it will also free all its children.</p>\n<p><strong>Groups:</strong> Nodes can be added to as many groups as you want to be easy to manage, you could create groups like \"enemies\" or \"collectables\" for example, depending on your game. See <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-add-to-group\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">add_to_group</span></a>, <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-is-in-group\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">is_in_group</span></a> and <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-remove-from-group\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">remove_from_group</span></a>. You can then retrieve all nodes in these groups, iterate them and even call methods on groups via the methods on <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_scenetree.html#class-scenetree\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">SceneTree</span></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Networking with nodes:</strong> After connecting to a server (or making one, see <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_enetmultiplayerpeer.html#class-enetmultiplayerpeer\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">ENetMultiplayerPeer</span></a>), it is possible to use the built-in RPC (remote procedure call) system to communicate over the network. By calling <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-node-method-rpc\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">rpc</span></a> with a method name, it will be called locally and in all connected peers (peers = clients and the server that accepts connections). To identify which node receives the RPC call, Godot will use its <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_nodepath.html#class-nodepath\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">NodePath</span></a> (make sure node names are the same on all peers). Also, take a look at the high-level networking tutorial and corresponding demos.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">script</span></code> property is part of the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_object.html#class-object\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Object</span></a> class, not <strong>Node</strong>. It isn't exposed like most properties but does have a setter and getter (<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">set_script()</span></code> and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">get_script()</span></code>).</p>\n"

For example, if a property is named <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">highlighting/gdscript/node_path_color</span></code>, it will be shown as \"Node Path Color\" inside the \"GDScript\" section nested inside the \"Highlighting\" section.</p>\n<p>If a property has <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_%40globalscope.html#class-globalscope-constant-property-usage-group\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">@GlobalScope.PROPERTY_USAGE_GROUP</span></a> usage, it will group subsequent properties whose name starts with the property's hint string. The group ends when a property does not start with that hint string or when a new group starts.

There is also a special case: when the hint string contains the name of a property, that property is grouped too. This is mainly to help grouping properties like <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">font</span></code>, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">font_color</span></code> and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">font_size</span></code> (using the hint string <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">font_</span></code>).</p>\n<p>If a property has <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_%40globalscope.html#class-globalscope-constant-property-usage-subgroup\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">@GlobalScope.PROPERTY_USAGE_SUBGROUP</span></a> usage, a subgroup will be created in the same way as a group, and a second-level section will be created for each subgroup.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike sections created from path-like property names, <strong>EditorInspector</strong> won't capitalize the name for sections created from groups. So properties with group usage usually use capitalized names instead of snake_cased names.</p>\n"

They precompute the effect of objects that emit light and the effect of static geometry to simulate the behavior of complex light in real-time. <strong>VoxelGI</strong>s need to be baked before having a visible effect. However, once baked, dynamic objects will receive light from them. Furthermore, lights can be fully dynamic or baked.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>VoxelGI</strong> is only supported in the Forward+ rendering method, not Mobile or Compatibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Procedural generation:</strong> <strong>VoxelGI</strong> can be baked in an exported project, which makes it suitable for procedurally generated or user-built levels as long as all the geometry is generated in advance. For games where geometry is generated at any time during gameplay, SDFGI is more suitable (see <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_environment.html#class-environment-property-sdfgi-enabled\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Environment.sdfgi_enabled</span></a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Performance:</strong> <strong>VoxelGI</strong> is relatively demanding on the GPU and is not suited to low-end hardware such as integrated graphics (consider <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_lightmapgi.html#class-lightmapgi\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">LightmapGI</span></a> instead).

All classes in the engine inherit from Object. Each class may define new properties, methods or signals, which are available to all inheriting classes. For example, a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_sprite2d.html#class-sprite2d\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Sprite2D</span></a> instance is able to call <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_node.html#class-node-method-add-child\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Node.add_child</span></a> because it inherits from <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_node.html#class-node\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Node</span></a>.</p>\n<p>You can create new instances, using <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Object.new()</span></code> in GDScript, or <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">new</span> <span class=\"pre\">Object</span></code> in C#.</p>\n<p>To delete an Object instance, call <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-object-method-free\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">free</span></a>. This is necessary for most classes inheriting Object, because they do not manage memory on their own, and will otherwise cause memory leaks when no longer in use. There are a few classes that perform memory management. For example, <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_refcounted.html#class-refcounted\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">RefCounted</span></a> (and by extension <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_resource.html#class-resource\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Resource</span></a>) deletes itself when no longer referenced, and <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_node.html#class-node\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Node</span></a> deletes its children when freed.</p>\n<p>Objects can have a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_script.html#class-script\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Script</span></a> attached to them. Once the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_script.html#class-script\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Script</span></a> is instantiated, it effectively acts as an extension to the base class, allowing it to define and inherit new properties, methods and signals.</p>\n<p>Inside a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_script.html#class-script\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Script</span></a>, <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-object-method-get-property-list\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_get_property_list</span></a> may be overridden to customize properties in several ways. This allows them to be available to the editor, display as lists of options, sub-divide into groups, save on disk, etc. Scripting languages offer easier ways to customize properties, such as with the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_%40gdscript.html#class-gdscript-annotation-export\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">@GDScript.@export</span></a> annotation.</p>\n<p>Godot is very dynamic. An object's script, and therefore its properties, methods and signals, can be changed at run-time. Because of this, there can be occasions where, for example, a property required by a method may not exist. To prevent run-time errors, see methods such as <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#id6\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">set</span></a>, <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#id1\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">get</span></a>, <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-object-method-call\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">call</span></a>, <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-object-method-has-method\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">has_method</span></a>, <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-object-method-has-signal\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">has_signal</span></a>, etc. Note that these methods are <strong>much</strong> slower than direct references.</p>\n<p>In GDScript, you can also check if a given property, method, or signal name exists in an object with the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">in</span></code> operator:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight-gdscript notranslate\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"k\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">node</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">Node</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">new</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"name\"</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">node</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>         <span class=\"c1\"># Prints true</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"get_parent\"</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">node</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>   <span class=\"c1\"># Prints true</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"tree_entered\"</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">node</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\"># Prints true</span>\n<span class=\"nb\">print</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"unknown\"</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">node</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>      <span class=\"c1\"># Prints false</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>Notifications are <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_int.html#class-int\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">int</span></a> constants commonly sent and received by objects. For example, on every rendered frame, the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_scenetree.html#class-scenetree\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">SceneTree</span></a> notifies nodes inside the tree with a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_node.html#class-node-constant-notification-process\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Node.NOTIFICATION_PROCESS</span></a>. The nodes receive it and may call <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_node.html#class-node-method-process\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Node._process</span></a> to update. To make use of notifications, see <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#id3\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">notification</span></a> and <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-object-method-notification\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_notification</span></a>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, every object can also contain metadata (data about data). <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-object-method-set-meta\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">set_meta</span></a> can be useful to store information that the object itself does not depend on. To keep your code clean, making excessive use of metadata is discouraged.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike references to a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_refcounted.html#class-refcounted\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">RefCounted</span></a>, references to an object stored in a variable can become invalid without being set to <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">null</span></code>. To check if an object has been deleted, do <em>not</em> compare it against <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">null</span></code>. Instead, use <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_%40globalscope.html#class-globalscope-method-is-instance-valid\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">@GlobalScope.is_instance_valid</span></a>. It's also recommended to inherit from <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_refcounted.html#class-refcounted\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">RefCounted</span></a> for classes storing data instead of <strong>Object</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">script</span></code> is not exposed like most properties. To set or get an object's <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_script.html#class-script\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Script</span></a> in code, use <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-object-method-set-script\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">set_script</span></a> and <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-object-method-get-script\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">get_script</span></a>, respectively.</p>\n"

It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. Godot's A* implementation uses points in 3D space and Euclidean distances by default.</p>\n<p>You must add points manually with <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-astar3d-method-add-point\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">add_point</span></a> and create segments manually with <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-astar3d-method-connect-points\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">connect_points</span></a>. Once done, you can test if there is a path between two points with the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-astar3d-method-are-points-connected\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">are_points_connected</span></a> function, get a path containing indices by <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-astar3d-method-get-id-path\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">get_id_path</span></a>, or one containing actual coordinates with <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-astar3d-method-get-point-path\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">get_point_path</span></a>.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to use non-Euclidean distances. To do so, create a class that extends <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">AStar3D</span></code> and override methods <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-astar3d-method-compute-cost\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_compute_cost</span></a> and <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#class-astar3d-method-estimate-cost\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">_estimate_cost</span></a>.

Those lines will be ignored when parsing the file. Note that comments will be lost when saving the ConfigFile. This can still be useful for dedicated server configuration files, which are typically never overwritten without explicit user action.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The file extension given to a ConfigFile does not have any impact on its formatting or behavior. By convention, the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">.cfg</span></code> extension is used here, but any other extension such as <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">.ini</span></code> is also valid. Since neither <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">.cfg</span></code> nor <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">.ini</span></code> are standardized, Godot's ConfigFile formatting may differ from files written by other programs.</p>\n"

Each scene has its own undo history and <strong>EditorUndoRedoManager</strong> ensures that each action performed in the editor gets associated with a proper scene. For actions not related to scenes (<a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_projectsettings.html#class-projectsettings\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">ProjectSettings</span></a> edits, external resources, etc.), a separate global history is used.</p>\n<p>The usage is mostly the same as <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_undoredo.html#class-undoredo\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">UndoRedo</span></a>. You create and commit actions and the manager automatically decides under-the-hood what scenes it belongs to. The scene is deduced based on the first operation in an action, using the object from the operation. The rules are as follows:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>If the object is a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_node.html#class-node\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Node</span></a>, use the currently edited scene;</p></li>\n<li><p>If the object is a built-in resource, use the scene from its path;</p></li>\n<li><p>If the object is external resource or anything else, use global history.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This guessing can sometimes yield false results, so you can provide a custom context object when creating an action.</p>\n<p><strong>EditorUndoRedoManager</strong> is intended to be used by Godot editor plugins. You can obtain it using <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_editorplugin.html#class-editorplugin-method-get-undo-redo\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">EditorPlugin.get_undo_redo</span></a>. For non-editor uses or plugins that don't need to integrate with the editor's undo history, use <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_undoredo.html#class-undoredo\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">UndoRedo</span></a> instead.</p>\n<p>The manager's API is mostly the same as in <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_undoredo.html#class-undoredo\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">UndoRedo</span></a>, so you can refer to its documentation for more examples. The main difference is that <strong>EditorUndoRedoManager</strong> uses object + method name for actions, instead of <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_callable.html#class-callable\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Callable</span></a>.</p>\n"

Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by Android.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It's recommended to use transport encryption (TLS) and to avoid sending sensitive information (such as login credentials) in HTTP GET URL parameters. Consider using HTTP POST requests or HTTP headers for such information instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> When performing HTTP requests from a project exported to Web, keep in mind the remote server may not allow requests from foreign origins due to <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS\">CORS</a>. If you host the server in question, you should modify its backend to allow requests from foreign origins by adding the <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Access-Control-Allow-Origin:</span> <span class=\"pre\">*</span></code> HTTP header.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> TLS support is currently limited to TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and TLS 1.2. Attempting to connect to a TLS 1.3-only server will return an error.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> TLS certificate revocation and certificate pinning are currently not supported.

The <strong>NavigationMeshGenerator</strong> has very limited to no use for 2D as the navigation mesh baking process expects 3D node types and 3D source geometry to parse.</p>\n<p>The entire navigation mesh baking is best done in a separate thread as the voxelization, collision tests and mesh optimization steps involved are very performance and time hungry operations.</p>\n<p>Navigation mesh baking happens in multiple steps and the result depends on 3D source geometry and properties of the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_navigationmesh.html#class-navigationmesh\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">NavigationMesh</span></a> resource. In the first step, starting from a root node and depending on <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_navigationmesh.html#class-navigationmesh\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">NavigationMesh</span></a> properties all valid 3D source geometry nodes are collected from the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_scenetree.html#class-scenetree\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">SceneTree</span></a>. Second, all collected nodes are parsed for their relevant 3D geometry data and a combined 3D mesh is build. Due to the many different types of parsable objects, from normal <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_meshinstance3d.html#class-meshinstance3d\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">MeshInstance3D</span></a>s to <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_csgshape3d.html#class-csgshape3d\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">CSGShape3D</span></a>s or various <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_collisionobject3d.html#class-collisionobject3d\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">CollisionObject3D</span></a>s, some operations to collect geometry data can trigger <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_renderingserver.html#class-renderingserver\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">RenderingServer</span></a> and <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_physicsserver3d.html#class-physicsserver3d\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">PhysicsServer3D</span></a> synchronizations. Server synchronization can have a negative effect on baking time or framerate as it often involves <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_mutex.html#class-mutex\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Mutex</span></a> locking for thread security. Many parsable objects and the continuous synchronization with other threaded Servers can increase the baking time significantly. On the other hand only a few but very large and complex objects will take some time to prepare for the Servers which can noticeably stall the next frame render. As a general rule the total number of parsable objects and their individual size and complexity should be balanced to avoid framerate issues or very long baking times. The combined mesh is then passed to the Recast Navigation Object to test the source geometry for walkable terrain suitable to <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_navigationmesh.html#class-navigationmesh\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">NavigationMesh</span></a> agent properties by creating a voxel world around the meshes bounding area.</p>\n<p>The finalized navigation mesh is then returned and stored inside the <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_navigationmesh.html#class-navigationmesh\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">NavigationMesh</span></a> for use as a resource inside <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_navigationregion3d.html#class-navigationregion3d\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">NavigationRegion3D</span></a> nodes.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using meshes to not only define walkable surfaces but also obstruct navigation baking does not always work. The navigation baking has no concept of what is a geometry \"inside\" when dealing with mesh source geometry and this is intentional. Depending on current baking parameters, as soon as the obstructing mesh is large enough to fit a navigation mesh area inside, the baking will generate navigation mesh areas that are inside the obstructing source geometry mesh.</p>\n"

These gateways are often also called \"routers\".</p>\n<p><strong>Pitfalls:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>As explained above, these calls are blocking and shouldn't be run on the main thread, especially as they can block for multiple seconds at a time. Use threading!</p></li>\n<li><p>Networking is physical and messy. Packets get lost in transit or get filtered, addresses, free ports and assigned mappings change, and devices may leave or join the network at any time. Be mindful of this, be diligent when checking and handling errors, and handle these gracefully if you can: add clear error UI, timeouts and re-try handling.</p></li>\n<li><p>Port mappings may change (and be removed) at any time, and the remote/external IP address of the gateway can change likewise. You should consider re-querying the external IP and try to update/refresh the port mapping periodically (for example, every 5 minutes and on networking failures).</p></li>\n<li><p>Not all devices support UPnP, and some users disable UPnP support. You need to handle this (e.g. documenting and requiring the user to manually forward ports, or adding alternative methods of NAT traversal, like a relay/mirror server, or NAT hole punching, STUN/TURN, etc.).</p></li>\n<li><p>Consider what happens on mapping conflicts. Maybe multiple users on the same network would like to play your game at the same time, or maybe another application uses the same port. Make the port configurable, and optimally choose a port automatically (re-trying with a different port on failure).</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong> If you want to know more about UPnP (and the Internet Gateway Device (IGD) and Port Control Protocol (PCP) specifically), <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play\">Wikipedia</a> is a good first stop, the specification can be found at the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://openconnectivity.org/developer/specifications/upnp-resources/upnp/\">Open Connectivity Foundation</a> and Godot's implementation is based on the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/miniupnp/miniupnp\">MiniUPnP client</a>.</p>\n"

almost any engine datatype inside of it. Variants are rarely used to hold information for long periods of time. Instead, they are used mainly for communication, editing, serialization and moving data around.</p>\n<p>Godot has specifically invested in making its Variant class as flexible as possible; so much so that it is used for a multitude of operations to facilitate communication between all of Godot's systems.</p>\n<p>A Variant:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><p>Can store almost any datatype.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can perform operations between many variants. GDScript uses Variant as its atomic/native datatype.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can be hashed, so it can be compared quickly to other variants.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can be used to convert safely between datatypes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can be used to abstract calling methods and their arguments. Godot exports all its functions through variants.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can be used to defer calls or move data between threads.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can be serialized as binary and stored to disk, or transferred via network.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can be serialized to text and use it for printing values and editable settings.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can work as an exported property, so the editor can edit it universally.</p></li>\n<li><p>Can be used for dictionaries, arrays, parsers, etc.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Containers (Array and Dictionary):</strong> Both are implemented using variants. A <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_dictionary.html#class-dictionary\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Dictionary</span></a> can match any datatype used as key to any other datatype. An <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_array.html#class-array\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Array</span></a> just holds an array of Variants. Of course, a Variant can also hold a <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_dictionary.html#class-dictionary\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Dictionary</span></a> and an <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_array.html#class-array\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Array</span></a> inside, making it even more flexible.</p>\n<p>Modifications to a container will modify all references to it. A <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"class_mutex.html#class-mutex\"><span class=\"std std-ref\">Mutex</span></a> should be created to lock it if multi-threaded access is desired.</p>\n"
